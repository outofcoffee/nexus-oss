 * A group repository is simply as it's name says, a repository that is backed by a group of other repositories. There
 * is one big constraint, they are READ ONLY. Usually, if you try a write/delete operation against this kind of
 * repository, you are doing something wrong. Deploys/writes and deletes should be done directly against the
 * hosted/proxied repositories, not against these "aggregated" ones.
